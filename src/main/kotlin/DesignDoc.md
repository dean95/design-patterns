## Introduction
* Complexity increases inevitably over the life on any program.
* Simpler designs allow us to build larger and more powerful systems.
* There are two approaches to fighting complexity:
  * Make code simpler and more obvious.
  * Encapsulate complexity (modular design) - Software system is divided up into modules that are relatively independent of each other.
* Use an incremental approach where design will be continuously evaluated and corrected on each iteration. 
* Reducing complexity is the most important element of software design.
* While reviewing code, recognize red flags and think about whether it conforms to the concepts discussed here.
* Balance between competing ideas and approaches. Try not to "overdo" it.
